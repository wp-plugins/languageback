Simple , minimalistic plugin that lets you set different locale for frontend and backend.

== Description ==

I created this plugin because i wanted this feature (to se a specific locale for frontend) out of my themes. I'm assuming i'm not the only one who would preffer to have the backend en_US only, so here it is...

It's not tested with other versions of wp except 3.4, but it should work without a problem at least from 3.0 onwards.

This plugin assumes you're not using a translation plugin , so, if you have bilingual or multilimgual blogs, use woth caution (and let me know ... especially with qtranslate :) ). 

I't not multisite tested/ready yet.

== Installation ==

Manually :
1. Upload `language-back.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Write down your locales for front-end and back-end in Settings > LanguageBack
