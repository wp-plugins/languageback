Simple , minimalistic plugin that lets you set different locale for frontend and backend.

== Description ==

I created this plugin because i wanted this feature (to set a specific locale for frontend) out of my themes. I'm assuming i'm not the only one who would preffer to have the backend en_US only, so here it is...

It's not tested with other versions of wordpress except 3.4, but it should work without a problem at least from 3.0 onwards.

This plugin assumes you're not using a translation plugin , so, if you have bilingual or multilimgual blogs, use with caution (and let me know ... especially with qtranslate :) ). 

I't not multisite tested/ready yet.
